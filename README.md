This bot consumes Wiki pages and can then be asked about the information contained on the page.


I wrote this bot to understand how retrieval augmented generation (RAG) can be done using ChatGPT and PineCone's vector database.


It could be further improved by wrapping this functionality into an API or by using a persistent data store to store the chat history.
